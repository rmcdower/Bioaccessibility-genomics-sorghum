# *For SNP permutation tests (SD3):*
# Analysis File = SNPPermTestQTLBio.R
# Data files:
Genotype file= GenotypesGxE.csv
Phenotypes 2022 file = GxE22forModelPerms.csv
Phenotypes 2023 file = GxE23forModelPerms.csv

# Notes
Code for permutation test is meant to run one year file at a time, read commented lines to make sure phenotype columns correspond to the correct year data file
